# **Stripe Webhooks (Optional)**

Stripe sends events like payout success or failure via **webhooks**. You can set up webhook handling to confirm when a payout has been successfully processed. This ensures that your system is in sync with Stripe's events.

To handle webhooks, you can refer to [Stripe's Webhooks documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks).

### 7. **Testing with Stripe's Test Mode**

You can use **Stripe’s test mode** to simulate payments and payouts without actually moving real money. You can use [Stripe's test card numbers](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) for testing purposes.

### Summary

If you've already installed Stripe and set up your keys, you’ll still need to implement the following:

1. **User Stripe Account Setup**: Create and onboard users using **Stripe Connect** to enable them to receive payouts.
2. **Payouts**: Use the `Payout.create()` method to send funds to the user’s connected account.
3. **Stripe Webhooks** (optional): Handle webhook events to track the status of payouts.

If you’ve already integrated Stripe and set up the necessary configurations (like API keys and account onboarding), the remaining tasks are to ensure the user is connected and initiate payouts accordingly. Let me know if you need more specific guidance on these parts!
